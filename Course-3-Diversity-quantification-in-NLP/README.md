## Prerequisites for the trainees
Before coming to Yerevan, make sure that you have met the following pre-requistites.

### Technical pre-requisites
- Laptop
- Python environment - 2 alternatives:
   - Google account to work with Google Colab (recommended if not/weakly familiar with Python; requires no installations)
   - Local Python 3 installation
      - Reasonably recent Python version (we tested with Python 3.13)
      - Development compilation headers: Python.h (works, but only do so if you have good knowledge of this)
      - C compiler added to your PATH environment variable (required for a specific package to install correctly) 

### Pre-requisites for the group assignment
- Check the list of [groups](https://github.com/UniDive/2026-UniDive-Yerevan-training-school#trainee-groups) and find the group to which you belong
- Make sure that you have received an email (sent on 8 Jan 2026) from the organizers which
   - puts you in contact with the **members of your group**,
   - links you to a **paper** on diversity quantification in NLP assigned to your group.
   - **Read the paper before coming** to Yerevan. Try to understand *why* diversity is important there, what *objects* are quantified for diversity, in which *processing stage* diversity is quantified and which diversity *measures* are used.
- If possible, arrange an **online group meeting** prior to coming to Yerevan to discuss your understanding of the paper.

## Group work in Yerevan
- In session 2 (Tuesday), the trainees will:
   - work in **groups** to analyse their pre-requisite papers following a taxonomy introduced in session 1 (Tuesday)
   - create a joint **presentation** (based on Google slides template that the trainers will prepare), with up to **5 slides** per group
   - select a **reporter** of the group (preferably a young researcher)
- Session 5 (Friday) will host the group presentations by the repoters: **5 minutes** per group + **2-minute** discussion

## Lab sessions
In sessions 3 (Wednesday) and 4 (Thursday) the trainees will work individually to set up a pipeline for quantifying diversity of a dataset. 
**Python** code will be used. It will be provided in 3 alternative formats: 
- Google Colab
- Jupyter notebook file (`*.ipynb`)
- strandard Python file (`*.py`)
